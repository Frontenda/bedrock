title: Sliders
---

MDC Slider provides an implementation of the Material Design slider component. It is modeled after the browser’s <input type="range"> element. Sliders are fully RTL-aware, and conform to the WAI-ARIA slider authoring practices.

Note that vertical sliders and range (multi-thumb) sliders are not supported, due to their absence from the material design spec.

Also note that we have taken certain deviations from the UX within the spec, e.g. nuances as to the slider’s motion across the track, as well as the color of the tick marks. Thus, there may be some treatments which deviate from the mocks. These deviations arose out of design feedback from seeing sliders used on the web, and thus have been endorsed by the Material Design team.
